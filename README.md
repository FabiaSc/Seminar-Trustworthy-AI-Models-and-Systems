Hello,

We would like to apologise for the slight delay in submitting our project. We ran into some unexpected technical issues while cleaning and uploading our code to GitHub (very large intermediate files and datasets, which forced us to reorganise the project and rebuild the repository several times before it could be pushed correctly).

The final report we are submitting is named “REPORT_Thrustworthy_AI_Models_Systems_Project”.

Best regards,
Fabia and Loan
